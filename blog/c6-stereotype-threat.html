	  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
	  <h2>The right one for the right job</h2>

<p>Stereotype threat is where anyone with a negative stereotype attached to their identity (color, gender, sexual orientation, and etc) comes into a situation where they might confirm that negative stereotype.  It reduces the performance of the person during that situation.  Stress is the factor, whether the person subscribes to the stereotype or not, the stress inhibits full performance. </p>
<p>To me, this feels like sitting on the edge of a whirling blackhole with bad metal music playing in the background.  The thoughts are hard to pull out of my head and the words won't connect with my mouth and suddenly there's a balance beam  across the blackhole which I need to walk.</p>
<p>Most of the time, this comes out at large tech events where I worry about sounding bossy when being assertive.  At a tech conference, I got into a discussion with a group about the difficulty in hiring a new staff member for a lower level positio.  I asked the question about where the ideal staff person would come from, and their answer was the person needed to have gained the experience from another position.  Their tech company lacked any internal training/promotional system to fill their own positions. I saw the Catch-22 they presented yet I kept my mouth shut and move the conversation to the food at lunch.</p>
<p> This derailment of my chance to speak up and assert my ideas/knowledge has occured other times and it all goes back to a voice in my head saying "Don't confirm it!  Women who speak up are not assertive, they are bossy".</p>
<p>Stereotype threat hits me when I'm in positions of leadership and with a seat at the table.  It hits me and hurts opportunities.  </p>
