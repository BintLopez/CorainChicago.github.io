<p>Stereotype threat is the event where anyone with a negative stereotype attached to their identity (color, gender, sexual orientation, and etc) in 

	I had a moment of clarity on stereotype threat when I recieved an email to this event:
	<img scr="../imgs/stereotype-threat.png"

</p>

<p>the words "guys" is gender specific, "beer and pizza" says we cater to men and their stereotypical food and alcohol tastes and Oh yey, while talking about semicolonos and a for loop, an drunk male might suddenly get the courage to say/try to do something inappropriate or we will not have the food you prefer to eat and will only provide booze or water from the tap with your hand to try and get (or other minority), and no location means...)</p>


<p>..but I felt like an overly sensitive, whiny feminist saying it (or even thinking it)</p>
<p>It took me time to evey express my feeling to my loving and supportive boyfriend.</p>
<p>It tooke me time to type it myself, and then I erased it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So, I waited for a man to say it.</p>
<p>And then I thanked him for doing what I couldn't for fear of being jumped on as a hysterical woman.  The fear of being attacked and fulfilling the sterotype of the overnly sensitive feminist who gets angry at people <i>just</i> being normal...but the normal is women pigeon-holed into subserviant positions in the workplace, such as not coding Javascript as it's a man's job or handing out with them unless it's for drunked luring/dating/sex purposes.</p>

In your post, discuss what stereotype threat is and consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your own personal experiences, try to think of situations that may trigger stereotype threat outside of the examples you researched.

Consider how affected your achievement or how it could impact someone else's achievement (if you are not sharing personal experiences)?

If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

Go into as much depth as feels comfortable for you. Again, if you're not comfortable sharing your own experiences, please apply what you've learned by coming up with some situations where others might feel it.

If you would prefer to answer different questions entirely, please feel free to do so within the context of stereotype threat.
