<p>When I think about my values, I think about my time in the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace Corps</a>.  What drove me to it (and I got out of the experience) was meaningful work, challenge and accomplishment, self-reliance and peace.  These values push a person to live up to them and I am no different. I feel a person gains great strenght from pushing their own limits and the testing for new ones again. </p> 
<p>Meaningful work gives me purpose. The power in the work attaches to the need you see yourself fulfilling.  Cleaning a house can be meaningful, and it becomes more meaningful if you are doing it for a friend who has been in the hospital for two weeks.  Meaningful work comes from doing it for others and yourself, not needing to be holy artruistic, but needing to be needed.  Using your specific skillset is important.  </p>
<p>When I think about my values and the experiences both enforcing and expanding them, I feel proud.  My strength and work during my time in Peace Corps continually reminds me of both my ability and endurance.  As I have held on to those values in the past, I will hold onto them in the future. </p>
