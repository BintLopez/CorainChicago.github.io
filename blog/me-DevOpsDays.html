	<p>My first tech conference was DevOps Days Chicago. Rather an odd conference for me as I was in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp and had yet to write enough code to deploy, let alone deploy continuously. In a comforting way, I ended up googling for the definiton of devops as the answers from asking around were too vague. Seeing a women on the speaker list for each day also comforted me.</p>

Hey Blue Martins,

My week started off with a positive pairing on the Nested Array activity (like flying through it) and learned:  Arrays are accessed through their index number and hashes are accessed through their key name.

Then I spend two days at the DevOps Chicago Conference. DevOps is the practice of continually deploying code, which is a new idea and also means many places horde their code inside and don't push it live for awhile. This is kinda like starting a challenge, writing 40 lines of code, refractoring it to 20 lines, and then deciding to run the rspec file.  Things I learned from the DevOps Conference:  Deploying code to production is a tricky business, make friends with the Dev Ops people at any job, feedback should be thanked as it's hard to do,  and tech conferences provide lots of t-shirts (they seem to think women like them small?).

During the Bingo challenge, I learned a good lesson on looping through arrays:  Make sure you don't loop more than the length of the array or else you will get an error with 'NilClass' as the loop with run but just through nothing.  I was looping through nothing for 30 minutes!

In approaching a problem, I got guidance on reading the instruciton explicitely.  Assumptions made an ass of me.  I made this beautiful guessing game which worked, except it still failed all of the rspec tests.  Lesson learned:  read the instructions and read the tests. 

Finally, I cried.  I cried because of stress and it felt good. If you haven't stress cried, I always try to control my stress cries with a good sappy movie (ex Whale Rider). This is crazy stressful, learning to code, finishing all of the exercises, writing, career change, $$$, meeting new people all the time and worrying they will judge, keeping up, writing code that fails, quitting jobs, moving, and $$$ worries. 

My week is trucking along (though I still look for the magical enumerator block to make each challenge one line :))
