	<p>DevOps Days Chicago is a tech conference focused on the development to operations side of the tech world.  This is where everyone who deals with deploying, servers, security, testing, and all of the systems needed to get code and the things created by code out the door and into use.  DevOps is a crazy ides of bringing together the team who deploy code and the team which develops code into a continuously flowing system.  It breaks the walls between creating the code and getting it out the door.  It also breaks the waves of deploying code into a river that streams out the door.  In DevOps, deploying code is a continual process. </p><br>

	<p>Natually, these are my own thoughts, learning, and </p>

	<p><a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-chicago/">DevOps Days Chicago</a> was my first tech conference and an ambitious one at that. I was in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (so at the very beginning of a code school) and had yet to write enough code to deploy, let alone deploy continuously. Later, I tried to talk about my learning with experiences devs and they said I need not worry about it...but I wanted to worry about it.  I want to touch my hands in the creation and manipulation of massive code bases, and I want my code to be deployed. Sometimes, life hands opportunities in weird orders, so I walked into the Chicago DevOps conference without a job in tech, in the beginning of code school, <strong>alone</strong>, were I was assured to be the odd person out by being female and having to google devops the day beforehand. I walked in to learn what I could and get comfortable with the uncomfortable ideas.</p>

	<p>So, what did this newbie learn? Many things. </p> 
	<ul>
		<li>First, there's something called "yak shaving", which means to fix one item, which breaks another, and then so back to fix it again (probably best to googe that definition). </li>
		<li> I watched an amazingly smooth and informative talk about the Orbitz deployment process.  They have an impressing continuous deployment system that looks like an automated factory in the slides. </li>
		<li>Don't praise unhealthy behavior!  A team staying until 3am should not be praised as angel saviors for coming in and losing sleep.  Disrupting a person's sleep cycle is not good, why are you praising it?  If you value your team, stop asking them to harm their physical health, mental health, and social lives.  Make the system better so you don't have to call them in, no one need to create heroes.  </li>
		<li>DevOps teams for different size companies require different skill-sets, hire for the skills needed, not the resume. </li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Make a safe place to do post-mortem.</li>
		<li>Professional men still get a kick out of flying the bird.  Why? I think they aren't secure enough to use rainbows and unicorns. Shock value is still shock value, I just can't remember any other significant part of the talk (it's been a few weeks). </li>
		<li>Feedback is important.  Give useful feedback, and thank people who give it to you.  It's not an easy thing to do. </li>
		<li>Take the blame out of feedback, state what happened (without assumptions on why) and how it effected your work.</li>
		<li>Monitor, set up your monitoring and use it.</li>
		<li>Monitoring is how you find the weak spots.</li>
		<li>Monitor so the issues are caught before your customers find them.</li>
		<li>Automate as much as you can in your production pipeline.</li>
		<li>Write tests to check and monitor the code being deployed. </li>
		<li>There is something called the Phoenix Project, read it.</li>
		<li>Companies need to think: do I have enough to need a DevOps team or do I need engineers to be good at it. </li>
		<li>There are no unicorns in tech.</li>
		<li>The audience really appreciated the opportunity to talk about feedback.  The room full of mostly guys needed the chance to talk and think about this skill.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These are just the big speaker points which stuck in my head in a more permanent fashion.  Other attendees might have walked away with deeper, more detailed knowledge.  Remember: I was starting from the zero point. </p>

	<p><a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/devopsdayschi2015">All the talks were recorded and are available.</a></p>

	<p>One of my goals for the conference was to learn what a new dev needed to know about devops and the operations side of a tech team. Here's what I learned in a nutshell to take forward: Make the devops or operations team your friend.  Talk to them outside of big deploys and include them in discussions of the code.  Work together to get as much automation in testing and deployment as possible so no one comes in on the weekend unexpectedly.  If code doesn't get out the door, it's everyone's problem, not just the operations side, so make them your friend at work.</p>
