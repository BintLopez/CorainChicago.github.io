      What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? Good question! The answer usually comes with a reference to this image:

    <p>This visual has a reason for being using, but it doesn't explain much without a bit of comparisons and a few definitions. </p>

    <h2>Margin</h2>
    <p>Margin is the space set from the edge of an object (or the objects borders) to the outside. It makes a space around the object, like a fence around a house or the distance noted in a restraining order. It says "Keep <i>X</i> distance from me!".  The border is excluded from this measurement and is treated as part of the object itself. </p>
