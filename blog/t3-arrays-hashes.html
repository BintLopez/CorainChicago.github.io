  Arrays and Hashes hold <i>things</i> in Ruby. Think of a grocery list, the list in an array looks like this:
  <p>
  <code>
    <precode>
      grocery_list = ["apples", "bananas", "wine vinegar", "eggs", "baking soda", "carrots", "flour", "potatoes, "baking powder", "beef chuck"]
    </precode>
    </code>

<p>Nice!  That's a list.</p>  

<p>So a list of items is an array. But, what if you don't want to walk with all of those heavy items home?  How would you narrow down the list at the store?You could do by weight or price, but some of those items are for a yummy meal and others are random items.  Which is important?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Hash.html">hash</a> is similar to an array but with key value pairs.  Hashes are like arrays, associative forms of arrays.  Huh?</p>

<p>Take the same list and put it in a hash:</p>
<p>
  <code>
    <precode>
      grocery_list = [ :apple_pie, "apples", :pancakes, "bananas, baking powder, flour", :beef_and_carrot_meal: "wine vinegar", "eggs, carrots, beef chuck", :restock,"baking soda", :side_dish, "potatoes"]
    </precode>
    </code>

<p>Now, looking at the list, I know that if I don't get the apples, I can't make apple pie and if I decided to not spend the cash on the beef, I won't have the beef and carrots meal. This helps my decision making.  Hashes help.</p>
